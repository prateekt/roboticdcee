The Robotic DCEE open source project aims to provide software support for robotic sensor networks. The open source project provides a software implementation of the DCEE framework. The codebase was built as a research platform by  the USC Teamcore group.

The Robotic DCEE project provides software for coordination on a robotic sensor network. Robots connected on a network can move to optimize their network links. The platform contains implementations of key DCEE algorithms that allow robots to coordinate their movements to improve their signal strengths over time.

DCEE (Distributed Constraint Exploration and Exploitation) is a general purpose framework for multi-agent coordination. DCEE was the result of the application of machine learning techniques to the more general Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP) framework.
