The installation has been tried out on two configurations of hardware.

The first is iCreate robots with a set of e-boxes (http://enl.usc.edu/projects/peg/platform.html)

The second is iCreate robots with a set of eepc netbooks (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqVw8rOGBGc, not our video but same configuration).

With the e-box configuration, we were able to use a tool called iwspy to get the network signal strengths from the wireless card. However, with the eepc netbooks, no known tool is there to do the same. Thus, the eepc configuration is still in progress as we have yet to find a tool to replace iwspy.

If you're looking to build your own robotic sensor network, the first configuration is recommended. If you want to do the second configuration, you will need to find a tool to replace iwspy and rewrite the iwspy driver.
